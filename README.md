# Portfolio Artifact: The Gaming Room Software Design Document

## Client Summary
**Client:** The Gaming Room  
The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), wanted to expand its Android-based game, *Draw It or Lose It*, to a web-based platform that supports multiple operating systems and devices. This required a scalable, efficient solution that preserved the game’s core functionality while enabling seamless integration across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

## Strengths in Developing the Documentation
I structured the design document to clearly outline the architecture, user experience, and technical requirements. Using object-oriented principles like inheritance and design patterns like Singleton and Iterator, I created a clear and organized design framework, making it accessible and easily implementable for both the client and development team.

## Benefits of the Design Document Process
Creating this design document helped me anticipate architectural challenges and optimize the application’s functionality and scalability before coding. This thorough planning clarified the project’s technical needs and helped align them with the client’s goals.

## Area for Improvement
If I were to revise this document, I would add detailed visuals in the user experience section, such as flowcharts or mockups, to better illustrate the game flow. These would enhance the client’s understanding of how players interact with the game across platforms.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I identified and integrated the user’s needs by focusing on a modular, platform-agnostic design. By aligning features like real-time updates and data consistency with the user’s preferences, I ensured a seamless experience. Meeting user needs is crucial to improve usability, enhance satisfaction, and increase player engagement.

## Approach to Software Design
My design approach focused on modularity, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility. Moving forward, I’d use additional tools, such as UML diagrams and wireframes, for visualizing and refining the design of similar software applications.
